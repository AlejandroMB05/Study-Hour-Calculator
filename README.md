# Study-Hour-Calculator

# Description

Study hours are the time you spend studying or taking classes.

The user enters their amount of classes and how long each of them last.

This program helps students to figure out how much time they have for studying by adding all of their class times and subtracting them with the goal for study hours the user entered.

# Future Plans

Be able to enter the exact times for a class instead of how long they last. For example, being able to enter "Start Time: 7:00 AM" and "End Time: 7:50 AM".

Be able to know how much time there is between classes. For example, "Class#1 and Class#2 are 2 hours and 30 minutes apart".
